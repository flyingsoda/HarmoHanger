# HarmoHanger
A Physical Model that emulates the sound effects of a steel clothes hanger

This will be done by taking a 2D string of Harmonic Oscillators, stretching them around in the shape of of clothesline and seeing what happens.

Chances are, the sound we get won't be very similar, but we won't know until we try.
